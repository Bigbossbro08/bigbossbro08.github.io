    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am primarily a programmer specialized in C++, C#. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside that I have other handy skills like JavaScript, HTML, specializations in game engines such as Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot and a bit of handy git skills...
      Occasionally I have other hobbies to such as basic video editing, 3D arts in Blender, sometimes using Photoshop and some other tools to do 2D drawing.
      One of the biggest hobby I do sometimes in game modding like changing some assets or practicing reverse engineering skills.
    </p>
    <p> I mainly work on my own projects but I also like to explore various areas of development. 
    </p>
